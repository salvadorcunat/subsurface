Introducing _Subsurface-mobile_
-----------------------------

Welcome to _Subsurface-mobile_, the mobile version of _Subsurface_, advanced dive logging
software with extensive infrastructure to display, organize, and interpret scuba
and free dives. _Subsurface_ runs on Windows, macOS, most common distributions of Linux.
_Subsurface-mobile_ is available for Android and iOS. Both are
open-source software (in simple terms that means that there is no commercial interest behind
them, all the source code needed to build them is available, there are no ads, no one is
monetizing your data, etc).

_Subsurface-mobile_ is a limited mobile version of _Subsurface_,
aimed at Android and iOS smartphone and tablet devices.
While the desktop version of _Subsurface_ shows much more detailed information
for each dive, the mobile version allows a more accessible dive log on the go. For example,
you can prove dive experience on a dive trip to dive shops or review
previous dives while on a dive boat. _Subsurface-mobile_ also allows
the gathering of GPS locations where dives are performed.
Assuming you have a dive computer that is supported by the mobile OS of
your choice, _Subsurface-mobile_ even supports the downloading of dives from your dive computer.

Users of _Subsurface-mobile_ typically use the
mobile app together with the desktop version of _Subsurface_,  sharing dive information
between the mobile and the desktop versions using a free _Subsurface Cloud_ account.
However _Subsurface-mobile_ can
also be used independently of the desktop version and does not require the use of cloud storage.

_Subsurface-mobile_ allows:

- Download and storage of dive log information using the _Subsurface_ cloud.
- Viewing this information on a mobile device.
- Manually creating and adding new dive records to your dive log.
- Download dive data directly from some dive computers.
- Editing most of the dive log data, e.g. dive-master, buddy,
  equipment or notes relating to a dive.
- Recording, storing and applying GPS positions to dives.
- Viewing the locations of recorded GPS positions and of dives
  on a map.

These items are discussed in greater detail in the following chapters.

_Subsurface-mobile_ has some limitations compared to _Subsurface_:

- Only a subset of the dive computers supported for download by the desktop
version work with _Subsurface-mobile_. This limitation is
mainly caused by hardware and OS limitations in the
two mobile platforms. On Android, a subset of
dive computers that use USB serial cables or a Bluetooth / Bluetooth LE interface
are accessible by _Subsurface-mobile_. On iOS, only Bluetooth LE based
dive computers are supported.
- No dive planner.
- No printing.
- No support for media embedded in dive profiles (_Subsurface_ allows to reference images and video clips directly in the dive profile).

== Installing _Subsurface-mobile_ on your mobile device

Find _Subsurface-mobile_ in the _Google Play Store_ or the _Apple App Store_
and install it. For Android devices without access to the _Google Play Store_
APKs can be found in the downloads folder on the _Subsurface_ website.

== Getting Support

The best place to get support is the https://subsurface-divelog.org/user-forum[_Subsurface_ User Forum]. Additionally, _Subsurface-mobile_ allows
you to send a support email by tapping on _Ask for support_ in the _Help_ menu. This will open an
email to our in-app-support address in the native email client, including the relevant logs.

== User Interface

_Subsurface-mobile_ uses the same user interface philosophy on both Android and iOS, based on an
open source project called _Kirigami_ that is maintained by the _KDE/Plasma_ development community.
This user interface has a slightly different look and feel than many native Android and iOS apps,
but we (the developers) feel that it is very easy and intuitive to work with.

On every screen you have access to the _Main menu_ through a _Hamburger_ button (three short
horizontal lines) in the lower left corner. Additionally, the _Main menu_ can be opened by swiping
towards the right from the very left edge of the screen. The entries in the main menu are all explained
starting in section xref:S_Dive_Management[_Dive Management_].

On many pages there is also a _Context menu_ available through a button with three vertical dots in
the lower right corner.
In the dive list this _Context menu_ can also be opened by tapping and holding a dive or trip header.

image::mobile-images/ActionButton2.jpg["FIGURE: Action Button",float="left"]
Additionally, at the bottom of many _Subsurface-mobile_ screens is a round
_Action button_ that provides quick access to the most commonly needed
actions on that screen (see image on the left). On some screens there is only
the round center button enabled, on others there are one or two additional
actions available on either side of that center button.

unfloat::[]

On Android devices, use the Android Back
button for "cancel", "discard" or "back" actions. For example, when
editing dive information, tapping the action button saves the changes while the
Android back button can be used to cancel the edit without saving changes.

The image below indicates some of the important features of the menu system.
On the left is the main menu, activated as described above. On the right of the image
are the items of all the sub-menus available.

image::mobile-images/Subsurface-mobile-menu-system.jpg["FIGURE: Subsurface-mobile menu system",align="center"]


All screenshots in this user manual are currently from the Android
version. The iOS screens look similar.

== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time

When you start _Subsurface-mobile_ for the first time, a _Subsurface_
splash screen is shown while the program loads. On some devices this
may take several seconds. Afterwards the _Cloud Credentials screen_ appears
(see left image below).

image::mobile-images/Credentials.jpg["FIGURE: Mobile credentials screen",align="center"]

=== Using _Subsurface-mobile_ without Cloud Storage
Tap the "No cloud mode" button. The app will only store dive log information locally
on your device. After the first start the dive log will therefore be empty.

=== Using Cloud Storage
The _Subsurface_ maintainer provides a dedicated and
free Internet cloud storage account for users of _Subsurface_ and _Subsurface-mobile_.
You can use this to store your dive log and to share your data between various computers
and devices. The _Subsurface_ team never accesses your dive data without explicit
permission to do so, the data are not used for any other purpose than providing them to the user who
created them. There are no ads and no harvesting / analysis of the data
stored in the _Subsurface Cloud_ storage. There is no monetization whatsoever.

_Subsurface-mobile_ is sufficient to fully maintain a dive log. In addition you can use the
more advanced features in _Subsurface_ when you have access to a computer while still
being able to work with your dive data when only a mobile device is available.

The dive data in the cloud are cached locally on any device or computer that is connected to
the _Subsurface Cloud_ account.
It is easy to create backups of the data (for example in XML format) on the desktop: both the mobile
device and the desktop keep a local copy of the data so that the dive log is always accessible, even
without Internet connection.

To create a _Subsurface Cloud_ account follow these steps:

1) Enter an e-mail address and a password in the fields indicated on the screen (see image above).
The e-mail address should be in lower case and the password should contain a combination of
upper and lower case letters and/or numbers.

2) Tap the "Sign-in or Register" button.

If you have already set
up an account on a different computer or device, simply enter the same credentials here.
_Subsurface-mobile_ will now download your existing dive log data. Once the dive
list has been downloaded from the cloud, _Subsurface-mobile_ usually works only with the the local
copy on the mobile device. This avoids long delays or even failure of operations if there is a bad
(or no) internet connection, a situation fairly common at many dive sites. Remember to manually sync
with the server after making local changes (either by pulling down on the dive list, or by using the
manual sync entry in the Dive management menu entry).

3) If this is a new cloud account, a PIN screen will open (see right image above). A PIN is e-mailed
to the email address entered in the previous step. Enter this PIN into the field indicated
and tap the _Register_ button. After the PIN has been entered it
is no longer needed - it just proves that this is indeed your email account.

At this point a new account has been created for you on the cloud server and access to the cloud is
enabled. In this case the dive list is initially empty. Start entering dives in the dive
log or download dive information from a supported dive computer.

Once registered, _Subsurface-mobile_ remembers the cloud credentials and it is not necessary to
provide these again when launching the program.

[IMPORTANT]
*Cloud problems: FAQ*

[blue]#After filling in the correct information and submitting it, I did not receive a PIN by email#

1. Check *carefully* that you didn't make a spelling mistake in the email address you provided. You would be surprised how often this is the problem that people encounter, as autocorrect often mangles email addresses.
2. Check that the return email containing the PIN is not in the SPAM/Junk folder of your email client.
3. Wait for a few hours and check again for an email with a PIN.
4. If there is still no email containing a PIN, send mail to in-app-support@subsurface-divelog.org

[blue]#I want to access the _Subsurface Cloud_ storage but I have forgotten my password. How can I reset my password?#

There is a _Reset forgotten Subsurface Cloud password_ entry in the _Help_ menu in
_Subsurface-mobile_, or you can go to the https://cloud.subsurface-divelog.org/passwordreset[password reset website]

Simply enter the same email address that you used during cloud registration and follow the indicated steps. A confirmation email will be sent to your account to prevent abuse of this system.

****


== The Dive List

Most of the actions of _Subsurface-mobile_ center around the dives in the
dive list. While the dive list is loading from the cloud,
a message appears at the bottom of the screen, indicating that the cloud is
being accessed, after which the dive list is shown. Once the list is loaded you can scroll up
and down through your dive history.
_Subsurface_ typically structures your dive list by dive trips, but using those is optional
(and for divers who are lucky enough to be able to dive all the time at local dive sites,
trips might only make sense for dive vacations).

Two xref:S_Dive_Management[_Dive Management_] actions are available by tapping on the
action buttons at the bottom of the _Dive List_ page:
To xref:S_Download[_Download dives from a dive computer_], tap the main action button. If you wish
to xref:S_Add_Dive[_Manually add a dive_], tap the + button in the action bar. Both of these
actions are described in detail below.

Tapping an existing dive on the list brings up a display of the xref:S_ViewDive[_Details View_]
for that dive including the dive profile, notes, and additional information.

image::mobile-images/DiveListAndDetails.jpg["FIGURE: Dive list screen",align="center"]

A tap and hold on a dive or a trip header opens the context menu for that entry.

For a dive this allows moving the dive into or out of trips or between trips, deleting
the dive or showing the dive on an integrated map viewer (assuming the dive has the
necessary GPS information). The context menu also allows access to the undo and redo
system that allows you to step backwards and forwards through recent changes.

For a trip header the context menu gives you an option to edit the trip title (typically
the trip location) and some quick notes for the trip.

=== Filter the dive list

unfloat::[]

image::mobile-images/FilterButton.jpg["FIGURE: Filter button",float="right"]
The left action button shows three horizontal lines of declining length, symbolizing a filter.
When you tap this button, a text entry line appears at the top of screen which will allow you to
enter a filter search term that is either used in a full text search, a search just of the people
involved in a dive (in the Divemaster and Buddy fields), or a search of the tags you have used
to classify your dives. Tapping the filter button again clears the filter and shows the full
dive list.

image::mobile-images/FilteredDivelist.jpg["FIGURE: Filter tool",align="center"]

[[S_View_Dive]]
=== View a dive

When you tap on a dive in the _Dive List_, a _Dive Details_ page with the dive profile
and many important details about the dive is opened. You can use a pinch gesture
to zoom into the profile. Tapping and holding with one finger (until
the profile becomes translucent) allows you
to pan the profile and see more details in specific parts of the profile.

You can view other dives by swiping the _Details view_ to the right (for the
previous dive) or to the left (next dive).
Using the Action Bar, it is also possible to delete the dive (tap the Trash Icon
on the Action Bar) or to view the dive location on an integrated map viewer.

The context menu (accessible by tapping on the vertical three dots in the lower right corner of the
screen) offers additional options to move dives between trips, the same delete and map options
already mentioned, and access to the undo and redo facility that allows you to step backwards and
forwards through recent changes.

=== Viewing the location of a dive on a map

image::mobile-images/DiveSiteMap.jpg["FIGURE: Map of dive site",align="center"]
In the _Details View_, you can either tap the name of a dive site
or the GPS pin on the
left hand side of the _Action Button_ at the bottom of the screen in order
to open a map with the dive site in an integrated map viewer.
This of course is only possible if the dive site is associated with GPS
information.

[[S_Edit_Dive]]
=== Edit a dive

image::mobile-images/DiveDetailsEdit.jpg["FIGURE: Dive edit screen",align="center"]
At the bottom of the _Dive Details_ screen, the action button is a pencil.
Tapping the pencil button changes the page and enables editing
the dive details, e.g. adding text to the dive notes
or changing the names or values of some of the information (see image on left).
It may be necessary to scroll the window to access all the available fields.
At the bottom of the edit screen is a _Save_ action button. Tap this to save
the new information, after which the dive list screen is
updated and displayed. To cancel any edits, tap the Android _Back_ Button or
the application back button at the top left of the screen on iOS.


// == Copy dive information from one dive to another
//
// When editing dives it is possible to transfer information from one dive to another. For instance,
// when diving with the same buddy and the same equipment configuration during a particular dive trip
// it can be efficient to simply copy all this information from the previous dive into the dive that
// is being edited. Currently a standard list of dive information is copied to the clipboard:
//
// Divemaster, Buddy, Suit, Tags, Cylinders, Weights.
//
// Copy and paste dive information is performed on the Dive List. Long-press on a dive. A panel
// with three icons appears on top the selected dive :
//
// image::mobile-images/CopyDeleteDive.jpg["FIGURE: Copy/Delete dive information",align="center"]
//
// To copy the above information to the clipboard, select the leftmost of the three icons. A "Copy"
// notification briefly appears on the screen. Now long-press the dive into which the copied information
// needs to be pasted. The same three icons appear on the target dive. Select the middle icon. A "Paste"
// notification briefly appears on the screen. This completes the copy-and-paste action. Continue by
// reviewing this new (pasted) information by manually editing the target dive.
//
// To choose what dive details to copy, long-press the copy button. This will open
// up a configuration page where you can toggle the details you want to copy over
// to the destination.

=== Deleting a dive

You can delete a dive from the dive list by long-pressing a dive and selecting delete in the context menu.
You can also delete a dive from the _Details View_ by tapping on the trash can icon on the right
side of the _Action Button_

If you deleted the wrong dive by mistake you can easily undo the operation in the context menu.

image::mobile-images/UndoDelete.jpg["FIGURE: Undo delete dive",align="center"]


[[S_Dive_Management]]
== Dive Management

A central  part of _Subsurface-mobile_ is the ability to store the dive
log using the _Subsurface_ cloud storage.
This provides security against loss or damage of the dive information in a local copy
and allows the desktop version of _Subsurface_ to
access changes made using the mobile device. This feature is accessed
through the _Dive management_ option in the main menu.

[[S_Add_Dive]]
=== Manually adding a new dive to the dive list

You can manually add a dive to the existing dive list. On the dive list
tap the "plus"-icon in the action bar, or use the
main menu and tap _Dive management  ->  Add dive manually_. This opens a screen that is
identical to the editing screen described above. When a dive is added manually, you
cannot directly add a dive profile from a dive computer. However, if you do not use a
dive computer, the duration, depth and several other bits of information about
the new dive can be entered. The _Action button_ at the bottom of the screen
contains a disk symbol. Tap this to save the new dive. To cancel any edits, tap the _Back_ button.
The left-hand image below shows a screenshot of a dive being created and the right-hand image shows
the same dive in _Details View_.

image::mobile-images/ManualAddDive.jpg["FIGURE: Manual dive entry screen",align="center"]

[[S_Download]]
=== Download dives from a dive computer

There are several ways to get to the _Download Page_. You can either tap on the main _Action Button_ on
the bottom of the _Dive List_, or you can select _Dive management ->  Download from DC_ in the main menu.
On Android devices, when you plug in a USB serial cable for a dive computer, the _Download Page_ will be
opened automatically.

The download feature on smartphones supports only a limited number of dive computers. On
Android devices these are typically dive computers using a serial USB interface
using a USB OTG cable or a simple USB C-A adapter on newer devices.
Android devices also support Bluetooth dive computers that
are supported in _Subsurface_ on the desktop. Both Android and iOS devices allow direct
download of dive data from a handful of Bluetooth LE enabled dive
computers.

Use the _Vendor name_ and _Dive Computer_ drop-downs to pick the correct
dive computer.
For instance, when using a Shearwater Petrel dive
computer, the vendor is _Shearwater_ and the product is _Petrel_(see left image below -
section Start the download).

TODO: image of DL missing - or link to the 7.2.3 Start the download

When downloading from multiple different dive computers, shortcut
buttons appear below the drop-downs to easily switch between them. In the xref:S_Settings[_Settings_] menu
you can remove these buttons, a useful feature for removing buttons of dive
computers that you do not use any more. Achieve this by selecting the option
_Forget remembered dive computers_ in the xref:S_Settings[_Settings_] menu.

==== Download from USB serial dive computers
This feature is not supported on iOS.

[width="100%", frame="None"]
|=======
a|image::mobile-images/USB-OTG.jpg["FIGURE: USB-OTG cable",align="center"] |
Most current Android devices now have a USB
Type C port and come with a simple A-to-C adapter plug, which lets you plug in
the dive computer cable into the phone or tablet.
For older Android devices with micro USB connector you will need to plug the USB
cable used with the dive computer into a USB OTG cable which,
in turn, plugs into the micro-USB port.
The OTG cable usually has a full-size ("Type A") female receptacle at one end which
accommodates the full-sized male plug
of the dive computer USB cable (see image on left). This means that two cables are used to connect
the dive computer to the mobile device. *Not all Android devices support OTG cables*
but usually all modern Android devices with a USB C plug can be used with a USB A-to-C adapter.
|=======

_Subsurface-mobile_ remembers the settings for dive computers that
have been successfully used (image on right, below). These appear
as buttons under a heading "_Previously used dive computers_".
Select the appropriate button. Having connected the USB dive computer to the
_Subsurface_ computer and having selected the appropriate vendor and dive computer,
ensure that the Connection text box shows the corresponding connection. For a small number of dive
computers the connection name shows the dive computer vendor, for most only the cable chipset vendor
(and USB connection number) is shown. Most users of course only connect one USB dive computer to
their Android device and then things are fairly straightforward. A dialog will pop up and ask if
you want to use _Subsurface-mobile_ to connect to the device. If you confirm, then _Subsurface-mobile_ will
open to the dive computer download screen with the correct connection selected (and if it can deduce
the correct dive computer based on the cable used, even that information is already pre-filled).

==== Download from BT/BLW dive computers

The process for Bluetooth download is slightly different between Android and iOS.

In our testing we got the best results on iOS when the dive computer was
in Bluetooth mode before _Subsurface-mobile_ is started. On most dive
computers this is done through a menu entry, others (like the Suunto
models) always respond to Bluetooth LE requests. However, on Android devices,
you should first establish a link between the
Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE dive computer and the mobile device using
Android utilities. See below for more details.

For Bluetooth-equipped dive computers and Android devices, establish a Bluetooth connection between the dive computer and the
mobile device using Android system tools to achieve pairing.
For many Android devices,
the Settings -> Bluetooth tool of Android is probably appropriate.
_Subsurface-mobile_ performs communication using both Bluetooth and Bluetooth-low-energy (BLE).
The best choice of Bluetooth communication is often made by the software and the user need not be concerned with this.
For dive computers with both Bluetooth and BLE, a separate button is presented on the download
screen for each mode of communication, allowing a choice. Use the _Connection_ value to distinguish between the
two options. In the image on the below right, there are three buttons labeled "Shearwater Petrel 2". These represent two Shearwater Petrel dive computers, one of which can communicate in both Bluetooth as well as BLE. The _Connection_
information indicates that the Petrel with no BLE is selected.

==== Start the download

With communication between dive computer and _Subsurface-mobile_
having been set up, tap the _Download_ button. Be patient because the download can take a while - with many
long dives and a slow BLE connection we have seen download times of 45 minutes or longer. But usually downloading
a day's worth of diving happens reasonably quickly.
The downloaded dives appear in the bottom part of the screen,
the most recent dive at the top (see right image below).

Each dive has a check-box on the left hand side, used for selecting which dives you want to add to the
_Subsurface-mobile_ dive list: dives that are not checked are ignored. Once you picked the dives
you want to add to the dive list, tap the button at the bottom left labeled _Accept_. The selected dives will
now appear as part of
the _Subsurface-mobile_ dive list. The downloaded dive information can be edited as described in the section
above xref:S_Edit_Dive[Edit a dive].

image::mobile-images/DC-Download.jpg["FIGURE: DC download screen",align="center"]

=== Manually sync the dive log with the _Subsurface Cloud_

As the name indicates, this ensures that the local changes on the mobile device and changes
made by other devices and computers to the data stored in the _Subsurface Cloud_ are synchronized.
It is highly recommended to sync with cloud storage after downloading new dives from a dive computer
or manually adding or editing dive information on the mobile device.

This can also be triggered by pulling down (and briefly holding) the _Dive List_.

=== Enable cloud auto sync

By default _Subsurface-mobile_ runs offline and only syncs the dive list
with cloud storage when explicitly told to do so (see the previous entry above).
You can choose to always sync with the cloud servers. This is not
recommended unless you are in
an area with a fast and reliable internet connection, as otherwise
_Subsurface-mobile_ might appear to hang between operations as it tries to
connect to the cloud server. Selecting _Enable cloud auto sync_ causes
the local dive log to be synchronized with the copy in the cloud after most changes as well
as (on Android) every time that _Subsurface-mobile_ is closed. iOS doesn't support the concept
of closing an app (you can just kill it, which doesn't allow for a final sync with the cloud).
In general it is safer to manually sync with the cloud once you are done making changes in
_Subsurface-mobile_.

=== Dive Summary

The _Dive Summary_ page provides a very simple overview of your diving activities - which can for example
be useful when documenting total dive experience and recent dive activity for a dive center at
the beginning of a dive trip.

The summary page lists the date of your first dive in the dive list as well as your most recent dive.
It also provides two columns of data for selectable time ranges (by default all dives in the dive list
and the dives during the last six months.

=== Export

The _Export_ feature is somewhat experimental. On Android it only allows the upload of your dive list
to two websites (divelogs.de and diveshare). On iOS it also allows local file based exports as _Subsurface_
specific XML files (both for dives and dive sites) as well as _UDDF_.

Tapping on _Next_ opens an additional page for login information (or a file selection dialog).

== Location

The fact that almost all smartphones have GPS facilities allows
_Subsurface-mobile_ to record
the locations of dives. *IMPORTANT: GPS-derived coordinates on a smartphone
are not always accurate and can have an error greater than 1 km. GPS accuracy
is determined by the hardware and software of the
smartphone as well as by the GPS settings selected within Android/iOS.
As of Android V6 select Android _Settings -> Communication -> Location -> High accuracy._*
If the smartphone is taken on the boat
during a dive, locations will be automatically recorded at regular intervals.
These locations can then be applied to dives in the dive list as described in following chapters.

[[S_ConfigureGPS]]
=== Configuring the GPS service

For most users, the defaults for tracking GPS locations will be
appropriate. If you would like to change them, go to
the _Main Menu_, select the xref:S_Settings[_Settings_] screen, and open
the _Advanced_ area on that page. Here you will find the section for
configuring the GPS service (see image below). GPS location data
are collected at regular intervals, e.g. every 5 minutes, or at regular
distances, e.g. after the boat has moved more than 200m, or a combination of
both of these approaches. Provide the appropriate information and
tap the _Back_ button. The program is now ready to collect GPS positions.

image::mobile-images/GPSConfig.jpg["FIGURE: GPS configure",align="center"]

=== Collecting GPS positions

[width="100%", frame="None"]
|=======
a|image::mobile-images/LocationMenu.jpg["FIGURE: GPS start",align="center"] |
In the _Location_ menu select _Run location service_.
_Subsurface-mobile_ starts to collect GPS locations automatically,
following the preferences specified as described above. While the GPS
location service is running, all menus have a GPS symbol at the bottom
of the menu, indicating that the service is active. After returning from
the dive, deactivate the collection of GPS data by tapping
the option _GPS -> Disable location service_. The GPS symbol at the bottom
of all menus disappears.

Collecting GPS fixes like this is relatively battery intensive and unfortunately
both Android and especially iOS have become increasingly aggressive in killing
applications that are running while the screen is turned off. It may make sense
to check between dives that the location service is still running.
|=======

=== Applying GPS data to dives in the dive log

After running the location service during a dive trip, first either download
the dives from your dive computer or manually enter the dives into the dive list.
Now you can apply the GPS positions to these dives.
From the _Dive management_ menu, tap _Apply GPS fixes_. The dive list contains the start
and end times of each dive. Now, _Subsurface-mobile_ applies the first
GPS position that falls within the dive period of each dive. This results
in a GPS position for each dive that is saved as part of the dive log.

=== Viewing the locations of all dives in the dive list

image::mobile-images/DivesMap.jpg["FIGURE: Map of all dive sites",align="center"]

The locations of all dives in the dive list can be viewed from the _Location_ menu by selecting the _Map_ option.
A satellite image of the world is shown. At that scale no dive sites are shown. If you zoom into a particular region
of the world the dive sites appear, indicated by red flags. Zooming in even closer indicates the names of each
of the different dive sites.

[[S_Settings]]
== Settings

The _Settings_ page allows the customization of _Subsurface-mobile_.
It is grouped into four sections.

=== _General settings_ section

image::mobile-images/GeneralSettings.jpg["FIGURE: General Settings",align="center"]

[[S_ChangeCloudAccount]]
==== Changing to a different _Subsurface_ cloud account

Some users have more than one _Subsurface_ cloud account and have a need to switch between accounts.
Tap on the _Change_ button next to the _Email address_ in the _General settings_ on the _Settings_ page.
This opens the _Cloud credentials_ page.
Here you can change the email address and password used and then tap the button _Sign-in or register_.
The appropriate dive list is shown.

==== Default cylinder

When manually entering a dive or when downloading from a dive computer that doesn't explicitly
include cylinder size information (very few dive computers support that feature), _Subsurface-mobile_
uses the cylinder that you select here as the default. If you don't set this entry, no default
cylinder is used.

==== Forget the remembered dive computers

Tap the _Forget_ button to reset the dive computers that are stored in the up to four shortcut
buttons on the _Download from dive computer_ page.

=== _Theme_ section

==== Color theme

[width="100%", frame="None"]
|=======
a|image::mobile-images/ThemeSettings.jpg["FIGURE: Theme Settings",align="center"] |
Besides the default blue color scheme, _Subsurface-mobile_ supports two additional color schemes
for users with different tastes (see image on left). All screenshots shown in this user manual are
based on the blue default color scheme. You can pick the _pink_ or _dark_ color scheme from
the drop down menu.

The boxes below show the various color choices in the theme of your choice.
|=======

==== Font size

Depending on the size and the screen resolution of your mobile device, you may prefer slightly
smaller or slightly larger fonts. You can make this selection with the three buttons here.

=== _Units_ section

Here you can pick _metric_, _imperial_, or _personalized_ units for the user interface.
In most cases _Subsurface-mobile_ should pick the regionally typical unit system for
your location.

=== _Advanced_ section

As the name indicates, most users will not need to make changes here.

==== GPS location service thresholds

As indicated above in the _Location_ section of this manual, here you can set the distance and time
thresholds for the _location service_

==== Bluetooth

Since most devices tend to find a _LOT_ of BT/BLE devices that aren't dive computers, by
default _Subsurface-mobile_ only shows known dive computers to make the connection list
easier to use.

This setting tells _Subsurface-mobile_ to temporarily show _ALL_ Bluetooth and BLE devices as
possible connections on the _Download Page_, not just the ones recognized as dive computers.
If you end up needing this option in order to select a dive computer that is not recognized
by _Subsurface-mobile_, please send an email to the developers (using the _Help -> Ask for support_
menu entry) so we can add the missing code to recognize your dive computer as well.

==== Display

_Subsurface-mobile_ tries to make efficient use of the available screen real estate of your
mobile device. In most cases this leads to reasonable choices regarding the number of parallel
columns that are being displayed. Some users have expressed the desire to force _Subsurface-mobile_
to show only one column in portrait mode, even on large devices like tablets, as this results
in a larger profile on the _Dive Details_ page. Select this option if you want to enable that
feature.


==== Activating the Developer sub-menu

This enables an additional menu item in the _Main_ menu which contains options which are almost
never useful for a regular users. Here you can find the detailed app log file as well as several
test screens that help the developers track down issues you might encounter.

== Help

=== About

This page shows you the exact version of _Subsurface-mobile_ that you are running and provides
a convenient way to copy the application logs to the clipboard.

=== Show user manual

This menu entry opens the online version of this user manual in the native browser of your
device. Unfortunately this option isn't available if your device is offline.

=== Ask for support

This item opens your default email client with a pre-populated email to the _Subsurface_
support alias and copies the app logs into that email. Simply add your question or the
but that you are reporting and send us your message.

=== Reset forgotten _Subsurface Cloud_ password

As mentioned earlier in this manual, this is a convenient link to a web page that allows
you to reset the password for your _Subsurface Cloud_ account.
